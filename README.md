ðŸ‘‹ I'm tetraphobia.

I'm a self-taught full stack developer. I enjoy a smorgasbord of different technology-related activities. I write software in Typescript on the frontend and backend. I specialize in UI/UX design for web-based products.

I also know Python, C, and a bit of Rust.

So yeah, that's me.
