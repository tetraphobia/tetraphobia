ðŸ‘‹ I'm tetraphobia.

I enjoy a smorgasbord of different technology-related activities. I write software in Typescript on the frontend and backend. I specialize in UI/UX design for web-based products.

Miraculously, working as a software engineer has not ruined my enjoyment of programming yet.

So yeah, that's me.
